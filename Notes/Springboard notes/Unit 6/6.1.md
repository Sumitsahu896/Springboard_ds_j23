You learned all about problem identification in the first technical unit of this course. If you'd like to review this topic before you get to work, **[click here](https://medium.com/@guymaskall/problem-identification-f7db429af6e0?sk=e88f6bedcd90289fc9348b259e02c1de)**.  

For the first step of this guided capstone, you'll fill out a problem statement worksheet based on what you learn by reading through _the Big Mountain case study overview given in the project instructions_. This task is very similar to what you did when working through the Problem Identification unit — feel free to refer back to the resources contained in that unit if you need a refresher.
