Get your lasso out — the second step in the data science method is **data wrangling**! Data wrangling involves taking raw data and preparing it for processing and analysis. In this subunit, you'll get an introduction to this important topic, which will also be explored in its own unit later on in this course.

Git and GitHub are the industry standard tools used for version control. Developers and data scientists use Git and GitHub to work collaboratively on codebases. You'll use both these tools throughout this course — and throughout your career as a data scientist. This video will cover the basics of GitHub, which you will need for the Guided Capstone. 

This video is part of the GitHub prework we provided earlier in the course. If you need a refresher, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Waf5FAatcCETRW-QE1_XyV4tgK7tOD5Otqw5gdTdR8Q/edit).

### Guided Capstone - Step Two

Steps:

1. Login in to your GitHub account. Navigate to Springboard's GitHub repository for the guided capstone [here](https://github.com/Springboard-CourseDev/DataScienceGuidedCapstone). Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account. Once you have successfully done this, you should see a repository called “DataScienceGuidedCapstone” in your GitHub repository.
    

1. If you do not know how to fork a repo, reference the “Fork A Repository (Guided Capstone” tutorial [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo). **Reference the section called “Fork an example repository.”**
    

3. Clone your forked repository locally. You will now have all of the project files for this unit on your machine. You’ll find folders containing Jupyter notebooks for each step of the guided capstone.
    

1. If you do not know how to clone a repository, reference the “Keep your fork synced” section of the Forking Tutorial.  **Only complete Step One and Step Two of this section. You do not need to complete Step Three.**
    

5. Open the 02_data_wrangling.ipynb notebook. The notebook will be under the folder marked “Notebooks” in your newly cloned local copy of the repository.
    
6. Complete this notebook.
    
7. Push the finished version of the notebook to GitHub. 
    
8. Submit a link to the notebook on GitHub. Specifically link the location of your notebook, and not just the general link to your GitHub repository.
