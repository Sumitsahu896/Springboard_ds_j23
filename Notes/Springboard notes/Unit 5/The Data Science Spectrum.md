The variable when it comes to success isn’t luck. It’s understanding how to dissect problems and figure out the right approach in a world where the blind are leading the blind most of the time.

Successful people go after what they want, but they mitigate risk as much as possible.

1. Apply to all the companies whenever possible
2. Apply for a bunch of roles.
3. Don't spend too much time in Resume. Spend in referrals.
4. Focus on both the parts of interviews, Technical and non-technial.
5. Don't ignore the basics
